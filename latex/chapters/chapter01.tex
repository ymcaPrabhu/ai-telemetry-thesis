\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:intro}
\section{Background and Motivation}\label{sec:intro-background}
Cloud computing has fundamentally transformed enterprise information technology architectures over the past decade. According to Gartner's 2023 forecast, worldwide public cloud end-user spending exceeded \$592 billion, driven by the adoption of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) models across industries~\cite{gartner2023cloud}. Organizations leverage cloud elasticity, managed services, and distributed workloads to achieve unprecedented agility and cost efficiency. However, this migration introduces significant security challenges~\cite{hashizume2013analysis}. The distributed nature of cloud environments, multi-tenancy models, dynamic resource provisioning, and complex supply chains dramatically expand the cyber-attack surface relative to traditional on-premises infrastructure.

Cloud-native architectures produce heterogeneous, high-velocity telemetry streams spanning multiple layers of the technology stack. Network flow logs capture inter-service communications and egress patterns; host-level telemetry records process execution, file access, and kernel events; identity and access management (IAM) audit trails document authentication attempts and privilege escalations; container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes generate pod lifecycle and network policy events; serverless execution environments track function invocations and resource consumption; and SaaS applications emit user activity logs and API call traces~\cite{awscloudtrail2023,opentelemetry2023}. Each telemetry source offers partial visibility into adversarial behavior, yet defenders lack unified frameworks to correlate these diverse signals in real time.

Traditional cybersecurity tooling struggles to meet this challenge. Legacy intrusion detection systems (IDS), originally designed for perimeter defense, exhibit limited efficacy against cloud-native threats that exploit lateral movement, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration across distributed services~\cite{chandola2009anomaly}. Centralized Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms face scalability bottlenecks when ingesting terabytes of telemetry daily, while rule-based correlation engines generate excessive false positives that overwhelm security operations centers (SOCs)~\cite{zhang2022ids}. Analysts report low confidence in alert fidelity and struggle to reconstruct multi-stage attack narratives from fragmented logs~\cite{darpa2020xai}.

Simultaneously, the regulatory landscape governing cloud security has intensified. In India, the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) issued directives in April 2022 mandating that service providers, intermediaries, data centers, and virtual private server (VPS) providers report cyber incidents within six hours of detection and retain system logs for 180 days~\cite{certin2022directive}. Globally, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes breach notification requirements within 72 hours and substantial penalties for non-compliance~\cite{gdpr2016}, while the NIS2 Directive extends cybersecurity obligations to critical infrastructure and supply chain entities~\cite{nis22022}. In the United States, the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) establishes stringent security controls for cloud service providers serving federal agencies~\cite{fedramp2023}. Organizations operating across jurisdictions must simultaneously satisfy multiple, sometimes conflicting, regulatory regimes.

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer promising avenues for automated threat detection and response at scale. Supervised learning models can classify known attack patterns with high accuracy, while unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms identify deviations from baseline behaviors without requiring labeled training data~\cite{chandola2009anomaly}. Graph neural networks (GNNs) enable reasoning over complex entity relationships, facilitating the detection of lateral movement and supply chain attacks~\cite{wu2021gnnreview}. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as SHAP and LIME generate human-interpretable rationales for model predictions, addressing the ``black box'' problem that has hindered ML adoption in security-critical contexts~\cite{lundberg2017shap,ribeiro2016lime}. Despite these technical advancements, substantial gaps remain in translating AI research into operationally viable, compliance-aware cybersecurity platforms.

The convergence of heterogeneous telemetry, escalating threat sophistication, and stringent regulatory mandates creates an urgent need for novel detection frameworks. Such systems must ingest and correlate multi-modal data streams in real time, accurately identify complex attack behaviors spanning multiple infrastructure layers, provide explainable insights to human analysts, automate response actions while preserving accountability, and demonstrate compliance with national and international cybersecurity policies. This thesis addresses these imperatives through the design, implementation, and evaluation of an AI-driven multi-telemetry framework tailored to cloud environments.

\section{Problem Statement}\label{sec:intro-problem}
Despite the proliferation of security monitoring tools, contemporary cloud environments suffer from fragmented visibility and inadequate correlation capabilities. Existing solutions exhibit several critical deficiencies that motivate this research:

\textbf{Telemetry Fragmentation:} Cloud platforms generate telemetry across disparate layers---IaaS infrastructure metrics, PaaS application traces, SaaS audit logs, container orchestration events, and serverless function invocations. Each source employs proprietary schemas, time synchronization conventions, and retention policies. Commercial SIEM and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) platforms typically integrate a subset of these sources through vendor-specific APIs, leaving blind spots that adversaries exploit. No comprehensive framework exists for normalizing, enriching, and correlating multi-modal telemetry while preserving semantic context and temporal ordering.

\textbf{Detection Accuracy and Explainability Trade-offs:} Machine learning models demonstrate promising detection performance on curated datasets, yet operational deployments suffer from concept drift, adversarial evasion, and opaque decision-making. Rule-based systems offer transparency but require continuous tuning to address novel attack variants. Anomaly detectors generate high false-positive rates that erode analyst trust. The cybersecurity community lacks robust methodologies for building hybrid AI ensembles that balance detection accuracy, explainability, and operational maintainability. Furthermore, existing XAI techniques such as feature importance and counterfactual explanations have not been systematically adapted to multi-stage attack narratives spanning heterogeneous telemetry sources.

\textbf{Real-Time Processing and Scalability Constraints:} Cloud environments operate at unprecedented scale, with large enterprises processing petabytes of telemetry monthly. Effective threat detection requires sub-minute latency to enable timely response and containment. However, batch-oriented analytics pipelines introduce delays incompatible with modern incident response workflows. Stream processing frameworks such as Apache Flink and Kafka Streams offer low-latency data ingestion, yet integrating complex graph-based reasoning and ensemble ML inference into streaming contexts remains technically challenging. The research community has not comprehensively addressed the architectural patterns necessary to achieve both horizontal scalability and sub-second detection latency.

\textbf{Compliance and Governance Gaps:} Regulatory frameworks mandate specific logging practices, retention periods, incident notification timelines, and data sovereignty requirements. Cloud detection systems must not only identify threats but also generate audit trails, preserve evidence integrity, respect data residency constraints, and integrate with organizational governance workflows. Existing literature predominantly focuses on detection efficacy metrics (precision, recall, F1 score) while neglecting compliance alignment, auditability, and policy enforcement mechanisms. No comprehensive framework maps cloud threat detection operations to the regulatory requirements of CERT-In, GDPR, NIS2, FedRAMP, and emerging AI governance standards.

\textbf{Operational Integration and Analyst Workflows:} Security operations centers (SOCs) employ diverse tools for ticketing, case management, threat intelligence, and incident response orchestration. Detection systems that generate isolated alerts without contextual enrichment or automated response playbooks impose excessive cognitive load on analysts. Research prototypes often demonstrate technical feasibility in controlled laboratory environments but fail to address the socio-technical challenges of integrating AI-driven detection into operational workflows, training analysts to interpret XAI outputs, and establishing feedback loops for continuous model improvement.

Given these deficiencies, the core research problem is: \emph{How can we design, implement, and validate an AI-driven framework that fuses heterogeneous cloud telemetry to detect and explain multi-stage cyber attacks in real time, while satisfying regulatory obligations and integrating seamlessly into operational security workflows?} Addressing this problem requires innovations spanning data engineering, machine learning, systems architecture, regulatory mapping, and human-computer interaction.

\section{Research Questions and Hypotheses}\label{sec:intro-rq}
This research is guided by four overarching questions, each accompanied by testable hypotheses:

\textbf{RQ1: Telemetry Normalization and Fusion} \\
\emph{How can heterogeneous multi-modal telemetry from cloud environments be normalized into a unified semantic representation that enables real-time correlation while preserving provenance, temporal ordering, and contextual relationships?}

This model will enable correlation queries spanning multiple telemetry types with $\leq$10\% false correlation rate.

\textbf{RQ2: AI/ML Model Selection and Explainability} \\

\textbf{Hypothesis H2:} A hybrid ensemble combining graph attention networks (GAT) for entity relationship reasoning, temporal convolutional networks (TCN) for sequence modeling, and Bayesian belief networks for probabilistic inference will achieve $\geq$95\% precision and $\geq$90\% recall on multi-stage attack detection tasks, while maintaining $\geq$75\% analyst agreement with SHAP-based feature importance explanations. This ensemble will outperform single-model baselines by $\geq$10\% in F1-score and reduce false positives by $\geq$25\% compared to rule-based SIEM correlation.

\textbf{RQ3: Detection Performance and Operational Efficiency} \\
\emph{What quantifiable improvements in detection accuracy, latency, false-positive rate, and analyst productivity does the proposed framework deliver relative to state-of-the-art commercial and academic solutions?}

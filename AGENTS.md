# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `chapters/`: Markdown drafts for each thesis chapter; keep filenames lowercase with underscores (e.g., `chapter_09_future_work.md`).
- `docs/`: Governance memos (formatting, ethics, DMP). Add new policy notes here using descriptive names (`docs/security_controls.md`).
- `latex/`: Submission-ready source with front matter, chapter `.tex` files, appendices, and `main.tex`. Build outputs write to this folder.
- `thesis_complete.md`, `thesis_outline.md`: High-level summaries. Update concurrently when major architecture or methodology changes occur.
- `thesis_package.zip`: Rebuild after substantive edits with `python -m shutil make_archive` (see Build section).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
```bash
# Compile LaTeX manuscript and generate PDF (requires latexmk)
cd latex && latexmk -pdf main.tex

# Clean LaTeX build artifacts
dlatexmk -C main.tex  # or manually remove *.aux *.log etc.

# Refresh distributable ZIP from latest LaTeX sources
cd .. && python - <<'PY'
import shutil
shutil.make_archive('thesis_package','zip','latex')
PY
```
Confirm the PDF renders without warnings before tagging a release.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Markdown and LaTeX files use two-space indentation for nested lists; avoid tabs.
- Prefer sentence case headings (`## Research Design`).
- Cite sources in LaTeX using IEEE style (`\cite{key}`); keep BibTeX entries alphabetized in `references.bib`.
- Name new documents descriptively with hyphen or underscore separators (`docs/telemetry_schema_notes.md`).

## Testing Guidelines
- Primary verification is LaTeX compilation (`latexmk -pdf`). Treat warnings about missing references as build failures.
- For notebooks or scripts, add lightweight sanity checks (e.g., `python -m doctest script.py`). Document bespoke checks in `docs/evaluation_reporting_template.md`.
- Store experiment outputs under `reports/` (create if absent) and reference them in Chapter 6 summaries.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Use present-tense, imperative commit messages (`Add fairness analysis table`). Group related changes: format updates, content additions, and data-refresh commits should be separate.
- Run LaTeX builds and regenerate `thesis_package.zip` before every PR.
- PR descriptions should include: purpose, affected sections/files, validation steps (build logs, rendered PDF), and linked TODO items or issue IDs.
- Attach screenshots of new diagrams or dashboard outputs when relevant to ease reviews.

# BMAD-METHOD Agents and Tasks (OpenCode)

OpenCode reads AGENTS.md during initialization and uses it as part of its system prompt for the session. This section is auto-generated by BMAD-METHOD for OpenCode.

## How To Use With OpenCode

- Run `opencode` in this project. OpenCode will read `AGENTS.md` and your OpenCode config (opencode.json[c]).
- Reference a role naturally, e.g., "As dev, implement ..." or use commands defined in your BMAD tasks.
- Commit `.bmad-core` and `AGENTS.md` if you want teammates to share the same configuration.
- Refresh this section after BMAD updates: `npx bmad-method install -f -i opencode`.

### Helpful Commands

- List agents: `npx bmad-method list:agents`
- Reinstall BMAD core and regenerate this section: `npx bmad-method install -f -i opencode`
- Validate configuration: `npx bmad-method validate`

Note
- Orchestrators run as mode: primary; other agents as all.
- All agents have tools enabled: write, edit, bash.

# Chapter 8: Conclusion and Future Work

## 8.1 Summary of Contributions
This thesis introduced an AI-driven multi-telemetry framework for detecting cyber attacks in cloud environments. Major contributions include: (1) a modular architecture unifying heterogeneous telemetry; (2) a hybrid AI ensemble combining graph, sequence, and probabilistic models; (3) integration of explainability, automation, and compliance workflows; and (4) empirical evaluation demonstrating improved detection accuracy, reduced latency, and enhanced analyst trust.

## 8.2 Theoretical Implications
The research advances understanding of multi-telemetry fusion, hybrid AI reasoning, and policy-aware detection. It contributes to design science literature by delivering a validated artifact and conceptual model applicable to cloud-native security.

## 8.3 Practical Implications
Practitioners can adopt the reference implementation, playbooks, and compliance mappings to enhance cloud security operations. The framework provides actionable insights for SOC teams, cloud architects, and regulators.

## 8.4 Limitations
Limitations include reliance on lab-generated telemetry, limited access to real-world breach data, and resource constraints affecting long-term experiments. Human studies involved a modest analyst sample size.

## 8.5 Future Research Directions
- Expand testing with real-world enterprise telemetry and live deployments.
- Explore federated learning and privacy-preserving analytics across organizations.
- Investigate adaptive defenses leveraging reinforcement learning.
- Develop standardized telemetry schemas and ontologies for broader interoperability.
- Assess integration with quantum-safe cryptographic controls.

## 8.6 Closing Remarks
By harmonizing AI, multi-telemetry analytics, and compliance, this research contributes to resilient, trustworthy cloud security. Continued collaboration among academia, industry, and government will be essential to stay ahead of evolving threats.

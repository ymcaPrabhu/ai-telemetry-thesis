# Chapter 5: System Architecture and Implementation

## 5.1 Overview
This chapter details the architecture, components, and implementation of the AI-driven multi-telemetry framework. The system is organized into five layers: telemetry ingestion, data fabric, AI analytics, explainability and response, and governance.

## 5.2 Telemetry Ingestion Layer
- **Connectors:** Fluent Bit agents, AWS Kinesis Agent, Azure Event Hub exporters, GCP Pub/Sub collectors.
- **Schema Registry:** Confluent Schema Registry maintains JSON schemas for each telemetry source.
- **Buffering:** Kafka clusters handle backpressure and decouple producers/consumers.
- **Security:** TLS encryption, IAM roles, API throttling.

## 5.3 Data Fabric Layer
- **Storage:** Delta Lake on S3/Azure Data Lake/GCS with partitioning by time and source.
- **Processing:** Apache Spark/Flink for ETL, stream processing, and feature extraction.
- **Metadata:** AWS Glue Data Catalog and Apache Atlas track lineage and sensitivity labels.
- **Quality Control:** Data validation via Great Expectations; alerts on schema drift.

## 5.4 AI Analytics Layer
- **Model Pipeline:** Feature store (Feast) supplies data to training jobs. Models (GNN, transformer, Bayesian inference) trained using PyTorch/TensorFlow.
- **Serving:** Ray Serve hosts ensembles; inference requests triggered by CEP outputs.
- **Drift Detection:** Alibi Detect monitors data/model drift; triggers retraining workflows.

## 5.5 MLOps and DevSecOps Governance
- GitHub Actions orchestrate CI/CD for infrastructure (Terraform) and application code.
- MLflow tracks experiments; models versioned and promoted through staging to production.
- Security scans (Bandit, Trivy) integrated into pipeline.
- Audit logs maintained for model updates.

## 5.6 Response and Orchestration Layer
- **Automation:** StackStorm playbooks initiate containment actions (IAM revocation, isolation of workloads).
- **Integration:** SOAR connectors (e.g., Splunk Phantom) for ticketing.
- **Feedback Loop:** Analysts provide disposition; captured via UI for model refinement.

## 5.7 Security and Privacy Controls
- Encryption at rest and in transit (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault).
- Role-based and attribute-based access control; just-in-time privilege elevation.
- Zero Trust principles applied to microservices communication (mTLS, service mesh).

## 5.8 Performance Optimization
- Horizontal scaling of ingestion and analytics services.
- Autoscaling rules based on CPU/memory and queue depth.
- Cost governance through FinOps monitoring (AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management).

## 5.9 Implementation Challenges and Resolutions
- **Telemetry Diversity:** Addressed via schema registry and normalization.
- **Real-time Constraints:** Optimized streaming pipelines and model serving.
- **Explainability Complexity:** Built SHAP services and narrative layer for analysts.
- **Compliance Requirements:** Embedded policy engine with Open Policy Agent.

## 5.10 Summary
The implementation realizes the conceptual architecture, providing a robust platform for experimentation and operational evaluation.

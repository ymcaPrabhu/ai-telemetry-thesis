# Chapter 7: Policy, Governance, and Compliance Implications

## 7.1 Alignment with Indian Cybersecurity Policies
The framework automates compliance with CERT-Inâ€™s 2022 directives by generating incident reports within mandated timelines, storing logs for 180 days, and maintaining audit integrity. It supports the draft National Cyber Security Strategy by enabling threat intelligence sharing and capacity building through standardized playbooks.

## 7.2 Cloud Service Provider Standards
Mappings to ISO/IEC 27017/27018, CSA Cloud Controls Matrix, and RBI cloud circular requirements confirm adherence to industry best practices. Policy-as-code modules enforce data residency, encryption, and access control policies across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

## 7.3 Ethical AI Considerations
Explainable AI modules comply with EU AI Act transparency obligations and mitigate bias through fairness monitoring. Model cards document intended use, limitations, and risk mitigations. Analyst interfaces provide accessible explanations, supporting accountability.

## 7.4 Operationalization Roadmap
- **People:** Train SOC teams on AI-assisted workflows; align roles with NIST NICE framework.
- **Process:** Integrate detection outputs into incident response plans; maintain continuous improvement cycles.
- **Technology:** Deploy framework components via DevSecOps pipelines; integrate with existing SIEM/SOAR tools.
- **Metrics:** Track MTTD, MTTR, and compliance KPIs.

## 7.5 Cross-Jurisdictional Compliance
Guidelines for organizations operating across India, EU, US, and ASEAN outline data residency, breach notification, and retention variations. The framework supports configurable policies to adapt to jurisdictional requirements.

## 7.6 Cost-Benefit and Sustainability
Cost analysis indicates moderate cloud expenditure offset by reduced breach risk and compliance penalties. Sustainability measures include carbon-aware scheduling and resource optimization, aligning with global green computing initiatives.

## 7.7 Policy Recommendations
- Encourage adoption of AI-assisted detection in national critical infrastructure.
- Standardize telemetry formats for government-industry collaboration.
- Promote responsible AI certification for security tools.

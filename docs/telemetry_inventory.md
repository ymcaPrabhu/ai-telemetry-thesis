# Telemetry Source Inventory & Access Strategy

## 1. Telemetry Categories
| Category | Examples | Primary Use | Access Method | Sensitivity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Network | VPC Flow Logs, AWS GuardDuty findings, Azure NSG flow logs | Traffic analysis, anomaly detection | Cloud APIs (AWS CLI, Azure Monitor REST) | Medium |
| Host/OS | CloudWatch Agent logs, OSQuery, Sysmon | Process/file monitoring | Agents, CloudWatch Logs, Azure Diagnostics | High |
| Identity & Access | AWS CloudTrail, Azure AD sign-in logs, GCP Cloud Audit | Credential abuse detection | API access via assumed roles/service accounts | High |
| Application | Kubernetes audit logs, container runtime events, serverless invocation logs | Lateral movement, privilege escalation | Fluentd/Fluent Bit collectors, Cloud Logging exports | High |
| Platform Services | AWS Config, Azure Security Center alerts, Google SCC | Configuration drift, compliance | API/SDK ingestion | Medium |
| Third-Party SaaS | Okta, O365, GitHub audit logs | Supply chain monitoring | REST APIs, webhooks | High |
| Security Tools | IDS/IPS alerts (Snort/Suricata), EDR logs | Baseline comparison | SIEM connectors | Medium |

## 2. Access Strategy
- **Cloud Providers:**
  - AWS: configure IAM role with `logs:DescribeLogStreams` and `logs:GetLogEvents`; use Kinesis Firehose for streaming.
  - Azure: Azure Monitor Diagnostic settings pushing to Event Hub; service principal with least privileges.
  - GCP: export to Pub/Sub; service account with Stackdriver Viewer.
- **Container/Kubernetes:** Deploy Fluent Bit DaemonSet; collect to Kafka topic per namespace.
- **Serverless Telemetry:** Wrap functions with logging middleware; use CloudWatch Logs Insights/Azure Log Analytics.
- **Identity Providers:** Use APIs (Okta System Log, Azure Graph) with token rotation.

## 3. Data Acquisition Milestones
1. Configure sandbox accounts with telemetry exports (Week 1).
2. Secure agreements for enterprise datasets (Week 3â€“4).
3. Automate ETL pipelines (Week 5).
4. Validate data quality (Week 6).

## 4. Security & Compliance
- Apply encryption at rest & transit (TLS 1.2+, AES-256).
- Mask tenant identifiers before storing in research environment.
- Maintain access logs; review monthly.

## 5. Documentation
- For each source, create YAML spec in `data/schemas/` containing fields, data types, retention.
- Provide sample datasets in `data/samples/` with README.

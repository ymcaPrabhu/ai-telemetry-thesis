# Literature Review Plan (PRISMA Workflow)

## 1. Objectives
- Map state-of-the-art in cloud telemetry fusion, AI-based intrusion detection, and compliance-aware security frameworks.
- Identify gaps aligned with research questions and TRL targets.

## 2. Databases & Sources
- IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, SpringerLink, Elsevier, arXiv.
- Scopus, Web of Science for citation tracking.
- Government/Standards: CERT-In advisories, NIST publications, ENISA reports.
- Theses: Shodhganga, MIT, Stanford, Oxford repositories.

## 3. Search Strategy
- Boolean strings combining `(cloud OR "cloud-native" OR "multi-cloud") AND (telemetry OR "log analytics" OR observability) AND (AI OR machine learning OR "deep learning") AND (intrusion OR attack OR detection)`.
- Limit to 2015–present for AI advances; earlier foundational works selectively.
- Apply filters: peer-reviewed, English; note exceptions for official standards.

## 4. PRISMA Steps
1. **Identification:** Export search results to Zotero; deduplicate.
2. **Screening:** Title/abstract review using inclusion/exclusion criteria.
3. **Eligibility:** Full-text assessment; record reasons for exclusion.
4. **Inclusion:** Final set for synthesis; update PRISMA flow diagram.

## 5. Inclusion Criteria
- Relevance to cloud security telemetry and AI detection.
- Empirical evaluation or detailed architecture discussion.
- Compliance/policy analyses relevant to cloud cyber defense.

## 6. Exclusion Criteria
- Purely theoretical without application context.
- Non-English unless essential standards.
- Outdated technologies superseded by modern cloud practices.

## 7. Annotated Bibliography Structure
- Use Zotero collections per theme (Telemetry, AI Detection, Compliance, Explainability).
- For each entry: citation, summary (200 words), methodology, datasets used, limitations, relevance to RQs.
- Sync with Overleaf and export BibLaTeX.

## 8. Gap Analysis Matrix
- Axes: Telemetry sources vs. AI techniques vs. compliance aspects.
- Highlight under-researched combinations (e.g., serverless telemetry + XAI).

## 9. Deliverables
- PRISMA flow diagram (created with PRISMA 2020 template).
- Literature review chapter outline updated iteratively.
- Annotated bibliography stored in `docs/annotated_bibliography/`.

## 10. Timeline
- Week 1–2: Initial search & screening.
- Week 3: Eligibility review, annotated entries.
- Week 4: Draft Chapter 2 sections; identify gaps.

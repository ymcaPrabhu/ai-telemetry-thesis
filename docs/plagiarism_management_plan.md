# Plagiarism & Originality Management Plan

## 1. Objectives
- Maintain similarity index below **10%** (UGC/Shodh Shuddhi threshold).
- Ensure proper attribution for all sources, datasets, and code.
- Document originality checks across drafting stages.

## 2. Tools & Schedule
| Stage | Tool | Target Similarity | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Proposal & Synopsis | Turnitin (department instance) | <15% | Revise flagged sections before submission |
| Draft Chapters (1â€“4) | Turnitin / URKUND | <12% | Annotate exclusions (references, glossary) |
| Full Draft | Turnitin (final check) | <10% | Generate certificate for submission |
| Pre-Submission | Shodh Shuddhi portal | <10% | Upload final PDF; attach certificate |

- Maintain versioned Turnitin reports in `compliance/plagiarism/`.
- Employ Grammarly/LanguageTool for paraphrasing validation.

## 3. Writing Practices
- Use Zotero/Overleaf integration for citation consistency.
- Paraphrase and synthesize; avoid direct copy even if cited.
- Use quotation marks for verbatim text <40 words; block quotes for longer.
- Document dataset licensing in footnotes/appendix.

## 4. Collaboration Guidelines
- Share draft segments with advisors via private repo; restrict editing rights.
- Track contributions with Git (commit messages referencing sections).
- Avoid uploading unpublished collaborator material without consent.

## 5. Audit & Reporting
- Maintain plagiarism log with:
  - Date, document name, similarity score
  - Main sources flagged
  - Remediation actions
- Append final certificate and log in thesis appendix.

## 6. Training & Awareness
- Complete institutional academic integrity module (IIT mandatory course).
- Review MIT Writing & Communication Centre resources on citation.
- Reference Stanford Hume Center guidance for paraphrasing.

## 7. Contingency Plan
- If similarity >10%: immediate revision, re-run tool, notify supervisor.
- For accidental omission: issue errata and update repository.

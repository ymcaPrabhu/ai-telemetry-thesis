# Research Design Dossier

## 1. Problem Statement
Cloud-native infrastructures generate massive, heterogeneous telemetry streams (network flows, host events, identity logs, API traces, container metrics). Existing Intrusion Detection/Response solutions struggle to correlate these multi-telemetry feeds in real time, leading to delayed detection, high false positives, and poor explainability. There is a need for an **AI-driven framework** that fuses multi-source telemetry at scale, adapts to evolving attack behaviors, and aligns with policy/compliance mandates in Indian and global contexts.

## 2. Research Objectives
1. **Design** a modular architecture for ingesting, normalizing, and correlating cloud telemetry spanning IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and serverless workloads.
2. **Develop** AI/ML models (hybrid ensemble + neuro-symbolic reasoning) to detect multi-stage cyber attacks with improved accuracy, latency, and interpretability.
3. **Validate** the framework through controlled experiments, analyst studies, and compliance mapping against national/international cybersecurity standards.
4. **Deliver** operational guidelines for enterprises/government agencies to adopt the framework, including ROI and sustainability analysis.

## 3. Research Questions (RQs)
- **RQ1:** How can multi-modal telemetry be harmonized into a unified knowledge representation that supports real-time correlation?
- **RQ2:** Which AI/ML techniques (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, graph-based) best capture complex attack patterns while maintaining explainability?
- **RQ3:** What impact does the proposed framework have on detection precision, false positives, and response times compared with state-of-the-art solutions?
- **RQ4:** How can the framework satisfy regulatory and ethical requirements across jurisdictions (India, EU, US) without compromising detection efficacy?

## 4. Hypotheses
- **H1:** A hybrid AI model combining graph neural networks with probabilistic reasoning will outperform baseline SIEM/XDR systems in precision and recall by ≥10%.
- **H2:** Multi-telemetry fusion leveraging streaming CEP and feature learning reduces detection latency (MTTD) by ≥25%.
- **H3:** Incorporating explainability modules (SHAP + counterfactual narratives) improves analyst trust scores by ≥20% in usability studies.
- **H4:** Compliance-aware orchestration can maintain regulatory adherence (CERT-In, GDPR, FedRAMP) without measurable degradation in detection metrics (<2% variation).

## 5. Conceptual Framework
- **Layer 1 – Telemetry Ingestion:** Agents & APIs capture network, host, application, identity, container, serverless events.
- **Layer 2 – Data Fabric:** Schema-on-read data lake with metadata catalogue, security layers, and streaming pipelines.
- **Layer 3 – Analytics & Correlation:** Ensemble AI (GNN, transformer-based anomaly detection, Bayesian inference) + complex event processing.
- **Layer 4 – Explainability & Response:** XAI dashboards, playbook automation, feedback loops to retrain models.
- **Layer 5 – Governance:** Policy engine aligning detections with compliance, logging, and audit trails.

## 6. Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Mapping
| Component | Current TRL | Target TRL | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Telemetry ingestion connectors | TRL 4 | TRL 7 | prototype connectors for multi-cloud environments |

- **Experimental Evaluation** using benchmark datasets and synthetic attack scenarios.
- **Field Studies** (if approvals allow) with analyst feedback sessions.
- **Policy Analysis** mapping outcomes to regulatory frameworks.

## 8. Expected Contributions

- Hybrid AI methodology balancing accuracy and explainability.
- Compliance-aware operational blueprint for Indian and global organizations.
- Open artifact package (datasets, code, documentation) supporting reproducibility.

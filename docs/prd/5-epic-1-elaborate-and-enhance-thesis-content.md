# 5. Epic 1: Elaborate and Enhance Thesis Content

**Epic Goal**: To transform the thesis into an excellent, defense-ready document that meets the highest global academic standards by elaborating each chapter with new content and references, and improving the overall logical flow.

**Integration Requirements**: All new content must be seamlessly integrated into the existing LaTeX structure, maintaining the current formatting and citation style. The final document must compile without errors.

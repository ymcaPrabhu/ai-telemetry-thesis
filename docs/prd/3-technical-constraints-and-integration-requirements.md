## 3.2. Integration Approach
*   **Database Integration Strategy**: Not applicable.
*   **API Integration Strategy**: Not applicable.
*   **Frontend Integration Strategy**: Not applicable.
*   **Testing Integration Strategy**: Manual proofreading, plagiarism checks, and validation of citations will be required for all new content.

## 3.3. Code Organization and Standards
*   **File Structure Approach**: New content will be added to the existing `.tex` files in the `latex/chapters/` directory. The corresponding markdown files in `chapters/` should also be updated.
*   **Naming Conventions**: Not applicable.
*   **Coding Standards**: The existing LaTeX coding style and structure should be followed.
*   **Documentation Standards**: The `docs/brownfield-architecture.md` will be the single source of truth for the project's architecture.

## 3.4. Deployment and Operations
*   **Build Process Integration**: The existing LaTeX build process will be used to generate the final PDF.
*   **Deployment Strategy**: The final PDF will be the deployed artifact.
*   **Monitoring and Logging**: Not applicable.

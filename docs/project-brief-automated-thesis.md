# Project Brief: Automated Thesis Generation Platform

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines a project to create a web-based platform that automates the generation of high-quality academic theses. The primary problem this project addresses is the significant difficulty and time commitment required to write a thesis, particularly for novice researchers. Our target market is PhD and Master's students, as well as other academic researchers. The key value proposition is a simplified, guided, three-phase process that leverages AI to produce a thesis that meets global academic standards, based on the knowledge and quality from the "AI Telemetry Thesis" project.

## 2. Problem Statement

Writing a thesis is a notoriously complex and time-consuming endeavor. Many students, especially those new to academic writing, struggle with the structure, content, and formatting requirements. This often leads to high dropout rates, extended completion times, and inconsistent quality in the final output. Existing tools, such as text editors and reference managers, provide limited support for the actual writing process, leaving a significant gap in the market for a tool that can guide users from the initial idea to the final, polished document.

## 3. Proposed Solution

We propose a web-based platform that will guide users through a three-phase process to create a high-quality thesis:

*   **Phase 1: Initial Scoping:** The user will answer a short questionnaire (4-5 questions) to define their research topic, field of study, and other key parameters.
*   **Phase 2: Outline Generation and Refinement:** Based on the user's input, the platform will generate a comprehensive and editable thesis outline. The user will be able to preview and customize the outline to fit their specific needs.
*   **Phase 3: Thesis Generation and Download:** Once the outline is finalized, the platform will generate the full thesis, complete with a progress indicator. The user will then be able to download the final document in both PDF and Word formats.

The platform will be built on the knowledge and quality standards established in the "AI Telemetry Thesis" project, ensuring a high-quality output that meets global academic standards.

## 4. Target Users

*   **Primary User Segment:** PhD students, particularly those in the early stages of their research who may be new to academic writing.
*   **Secondary User Segment:** Master's students, undergraduate students writing honors theses, and other academic researchers who need to produce a high-quality research paper.

## 5. Goals & Success Metrics

*   **Business Objectives:**
    *   Achieve a high user adoption rate within the first year of launch.
    *   Establish the platform as a leader in the academic writing market.
*   **User Success Metrics:**
    *   High user satisfaction scores (e.g., NPS > 50).
    *   High thesis completion rates for users who start the process.
*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    *   Number of active users.
    *   User retention rate.
    *   Thesis completion rate.

## 6. MVP Scope

*   **Core Features (Must Have):**
    *   A simple and intuitive web interface.
    *   The three-phase thesis generation process described above.
    *   The ability to download the final thesis in PDF and Word formats.
*   **Out of Scope for MVP:**
    *   Advanced features such as real-time collaboration, integration with third-party tools (e.g., reference managers, plagiarism checkers), and support for multiple languages.

## 7. Post-MVP Vision

*   **Phase 2 Features:**
    *   Real-time collaboration features to allow users to work with their supervisors and peers.
    *   Integration with popular reference managers like Zotero and Mendeley.
    *   Integration with plagiarism checkers like Turnitin.
*   **Long-term Vision:**
    *   To become a comprehensive platform for academic research, including tools for literature review, data analysis, and publication.

## 8. Technical Considerations

*   **Platform Requirements:**
    *   A web-based application accessible from all major browsers.
*   **Technology Preferences:**
    *   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript (with minimal dependencies).
    *   **Backend:** Node.js.
    *   **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
    *   **Hosting/Infrastructure:** AWS or Google Cloud.
*   **Architecture Considerations:**
    *   A microservices architecture to allow for scalability and flexibility.

## 9. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Constraints:**
    *   The initial version of the tool will be based on the knowledge and quality standards from the "AI Telemetry Thesis" project.
*   **Key Assumptions:**
    *   There is a significant market for a tool that automates the thesis writing process.
    *   Users are willing to pay for a high-quality tool that can save them time and effort.

## 10. Risks & Open Questions

*   **Key Risks:**
    *   The AI-generated content may not be of high enough quality to meet the standards of academic writing.
    *   The tool may be difficult to use for novice users.
*   **Open Questions:**
    *   What is the best business model for the tool (e.g., subscription, one-time fee)?
    *   How can we ensure the academic integrity of the generated content and avoid plagiarism?

## 11. Next Steps

*   **Immediate Actions:**
    *   Create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the project.
    *   Develop a prototype of the user interface.

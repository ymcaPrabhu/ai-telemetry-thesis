## 4. Epic and Story Structure

### 4.1. Epic Approach
**Epic Structure Decision**: This enhancement will be structured as a single, comprehensive epic. This is because the work is focused on a single, cohesive goal: elaborating the thesis to meet the standards of a top-tier university.

## 5. Epic 1: Elaborate and Enhance Thesis Content

**Epic Goal**: To transform the thesis into an excellent, defense-ready document that meets the highest global academic standards by elaborating each chapter with new content and references, and improving the overall logical flow.

**Integration Requirements**: All new content must be seamlessly integrated into the existing LaTeX structure, maintaining the current formatting and citation style. The final document must compile without errors.

# AI/ML Modeling & Experiment Protocol

## 1. Modeling Strategy
- **Baseline Models:** Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LSTM autoencoder for anomaly detection.
- **Proposed Hybrid:**
  - Graph Neural Network (GNN) capturing entity relationship graphs.
  - Transformer-based sequence model for temporal patterns.
  - Bayesian belief network for probabilistic inference.
  - Ensemble fusion layer combining outputs with weighted voting.
- **Explainability:** SHAP, Integrated Gradients, Counterfactual explanations.
- **Continual Learning:** Incremental updates with drift detection.

## 2. Feature Engineering
- Normalize telemetry to common schema.
- Extract features: frequency counts, entropy, API call sequences, graph connectivity.
- Use feature stores (Feast) for reproducibility.

## 3. Experiment Protocol
- Define experiment IDs (EXP-001 etc.) with YAML config.
- Record dataset versions, model parameters, training environment.
- Use MLflow for tracking metrics, artifacts, and lineage.
- Perform k-fold cross-validation; hold-out test sets.
- Conduct ablation studies removing telemetry sources to assess contribution.

## 4. Evaluation Metrics
- Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), Mean Time to Respond (MTTR).
- False Positive Rate, Alert Volume.
- Explainability metrics (fidelity, stability, analyst usability scores).
- Fairness metrics per tenant/workload.

## 5. Experiment Registry
- Maintain registry in `experiments/registry.yaml` capturing:
  - Experiment ID
  - Objective & hypothesis linkage
  - Dataset references
  - Model configuration
  - Results summary
  - Reviewer sign-off

## 6. Reproducibility
- Containerize training pipelines (Docker + NVIDIA CUDA if required).
- Provide notebooks in `notebooks/` demonstrating experiments.
- Publish code with unit/integration tests (PyTest).
- Document environment (`environment.yml`/`requirements.txt`).

## 7. Responsible AI
- Bias evaluation across tenants, geographies.
- Model cards summarizing intended use, limitations.
- Risk mitigation plan for misclassifications.

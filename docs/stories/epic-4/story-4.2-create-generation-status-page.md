# Story 4.2: Create the generation status page

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to see the progress of the thesis generation,
**so that** I know how long it will take.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The generation status page displays an overall progress bar.
2. The generation status page displays the thesis outline.
3. Each section in the outline is color-coded to indicate its status (e.g., gray for pending, blue for in-progress, green for complete).
4. The user is notified when the generation is complete.

# Story 4.1: Create the thesis generation engine

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to create a thesis generation engine,
**so that** we can generate the full thesis based on the finalized outline.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The thesis generation engine can generate a thesis in both PDF and Word formats.
2. The generated thesis is based on the finalized outline.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1 (AC: #1)
    - [x] Create a new module for the thesis generation engine.
    - [x] Implement the logic for generating the thesis in PDF format.
    - [x] Implement the logic for generating the thesis in Word format.
- [x] Task 2 (AC: #2)
    - [x] The thesis should be generated based on the finalized outline.

## Dev Notes

This story implements the core logic for generating the final thesis. This will likely involve using a large language model (LLM) to generate the content for each section of the thesis, and then using a tool like Pandoc to convert the content to PDF and Word formats.

### Testing

- Unit tests should be created for the thesis generation engine.

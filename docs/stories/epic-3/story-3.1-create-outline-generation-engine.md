# Story 3.1: Create the outline generation engine

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to create an outline generation engine,
**so that** we can generate a comprehensive thesis outline based on the user's input.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The outline generation engine can generate a thesis outline in a structured format (e.g., JSON).
2. The generated outline is based on the user's input from Phase 1.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1 (AC: #1)
    - [x] Create a new module for the outline generation engine.
    - [x] Implement the logic for generating the outline.
- [x] Task 2 (AC: #2)
    - [x] The outline should be generated based on the parameters from the user's input.

## Dev Notes

This story implements the core logic for generating the thesis outline. This will likely involve using a large language model (LLM) to generate the outline based on the user's input.

### Testing

- Unit tests should be created for the outline generation engine.

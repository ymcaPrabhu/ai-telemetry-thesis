# Story 1.1: Set up the project structure

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the initial project structure, including the necessary directories and configuration files,
**so that** we have a clean and organized codebase to work with.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The project has a well-defined directory structure.
2. The project has a `package.json` file with the necessary dependencies.
3. The project has a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from version control.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1 (AC: #1)
    - [x] Create the `apps/web` and `apps/api` directories.
    - [x] Create the `packages/shared` directory.
- [x] Task 2 (AC: #2)
    - [x] Create a `package.json` file in the root of the project.
    - [x] Create a `package.json` file in each of the `apps/web`, `apps/api`, and `packages/shared` directories.
- [x] Task 3 (AC: #3)
    - [x] Create a `.gitignore` file in the root of the project.

## Dev Notes

This story sets up the basic structure of the monorepo. The `apps` directory will contain the frontend and backend applications, and the `packages` directory will contain shared code.

### Testing

- No automated tests are required for this story.
- Manual verification of the directory structure and file creation is sufficient.

# Story 1.2: Set up the web server

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up a basic web server using Node.js,
**so that** we can serve the web application to users.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The web server can be started with a single command.
2. The web server can serve a simple "Hello, World!" page.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1 (AC: #1)
    - [x] Create a `server.js` file in the `apps/api` directory.
    - [x] Add the necessary code to create a basic Express server.
- [x] Task 2 (AC: #2)
    - [x] Create a default route that returns "Hello, World!".

## Dev Notes

This story sets up the basic web server that will be used to serve the application.

### Testing

- Manual verification by starting the server and accessing the default route in a browser is sufficient.

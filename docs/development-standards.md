# Thesis Enhancement Standards

## 1. Quality Bar for Academic References

All new academic references added to the thesis must meet the following criteria:

*   **Source Type**: The reference must be from a peer-reviewed publication.
    *   **Preferred**: Top-tier journals and conferences (e.g., IEEE, ACM, USENIX, etc.).
    *   **Acceptable**: Reputable academic books and dissertations.
    *   **Avoid**: Pre-prints (e.g., arXiv) unless the work is highly influential and recent, blog posts, and non-academic websites.
*   **Recency**: The reference should be published within the last 5 years, unless it is a foundational paper in the field.
*   **Relevance**: The reference must be directly relevant to the topic being discussed.

## 2. Style Guide for New Content

All new content added to the thesis must adhere to the following style guide:

*   **Tone**: The tone must be formal, objective, and scholarly, consistent with the existing content of the thesis.
*   **Depth**: Each new set of paragraphs should provide a deep and insightful analysis of the topic, not just a superficial summary. The content should demonstrate critical thinking and a thorough understanding of the subject matter.
*   **Structure**:
    *   Each new paragraph should start with a clear topic sentence.
    *   The arguments presented should be logical and well-supported by evidence (i.e., citations).
    *   The new paragraphs should integrate seamlessly with the existing content, ensuring a smooth and logical flow.
*   **Language**:
    *   Use clear and concise language.
    *   Avoid jargon where possible, or define it clearly if it is necessary.
    *   Follow standard academic writing conventions for grammar, punctuation, and spelling.

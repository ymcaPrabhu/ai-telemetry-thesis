# myprj-reseaech

Research workspace initialized on demand. Populate this directory with project documentation, datasets, and analyses as the scope evolves.

## Getting Started

- Add subdirectories such as `notes/`, `data/`, and `reports/` as project needs grow.
- Track tasks in a `TODO.md` file or integrate with your preferred project management tooling.
- Document assumptions, methodologies, and data sources to maintain reproducibility.

## Next Steps

1. Define the research problem statement and objectives.
2. Outline data requirements and collection strategies.
3. Establish analytical workflows and validation criteria.

Feel free to modify this scaffold to suit the project's conventions.
